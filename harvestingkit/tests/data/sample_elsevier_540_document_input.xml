We find that, early in gut development, proliferating progenitors expressing ISC markers are evenly distributed throughout the epithelium, in both the chick and mouse. However, as the villi form, the putative stem cells become restricted to the base of the villi. This shift in the localization is driven by mechanically influenced reciprocal signaling between the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. Buckling forces physically distort the shape of the morphogenic field, causing local maxima of epithelial signals, in particular Shh, at the tip of each villus. This induces a suite of high-threshold response genes in the underlying mesenchyme to form a signaling center called the “villus cluster.” Villus cluster signals, notably Bmp4, feed back on the overlying epithelium to ultimately restrict the stem cells to the base of each villus.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec><ce:abstract-sec id="abssec0515"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0515">Video Abstract</ce:section-title><ce:simple-para view="extended" id="abspara0515"><ce:display><ce:e-component role="video-abstract" id="mmc2"><ce:link locator="mmc2"/></ce:e-component></ce:display></ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:abstract class="graphical" id="abs0015"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0015">Graphical Abstract</ce:section-title><ce:abstract-sec id="abssec0015"><ce:simple-para id="abspara0015"><ce:display><ce:figure id="undfig1"><ce:link locator="fx1"/></ce:figure></ce:display></ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:abstract class="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0020">Highlights</ce:section-title><ce:abstract-sec id="abssec0020"><ce:simple-para id="abspara0020"><ce:list id="ulist0010"><ce:list-item id="u0010"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0010">The entire embryonic gut epithelium expresses intestinal stem cell (ISC) markers</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0015"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0015">As villi form, BMP activity from underlying mesenchyme restricts ISCs to their base</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0020"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0020">The mesenchymal Bmp expression is induced at villus tips by Shh from the endoderm</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="u0025"><ce:label>•</ce:label><ce:para id="p0025">Uniformly secreted Shh is concentrated by the physically driven villus architecture</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:abstract class="teaser" id="abs0025"><ce:abstract-sec id="abssec0025"><ce:simple-para id="abspara0025">The buckling of the epithelial surface during the formation of intestinal villi creates pockets under the villus tips that concentrate the morphogen Shh, thereby restricting intestinal stem cells to the base.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract></head><body><ce:sections><ce:section id="sec1"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0025">Introduction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0030">Although studies of stem cells have revealed a great deal about maintenance and propagation, the origin of most adult stem cell populations remains an open question. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) have been particularly well studied. A number of important factors have been described as being produced in the ISC niche to maintain their multipotency and proliferative potential, including canonical Wnt signaling (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib35" id="crosref0070">Spence et al., 2011</ce:cross-ref>). The identification of genetic ISC markers in the adult intestine, such as Lgr5, has made it possible to identify the location of these cells. In the adult Lgr5-positive ISCs reside in the intestinal crypt, found below the base of each (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib1" id="crosref0075">Barker et al., 2007</ce:cross-ref>). The earliest known expression of Lgr5 is just after birth in mouse (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib20" id="crosref0080">Kim et al., 2012</ce:cross-ref>). At this time, Lgr5 is expressed at the base of each villus, where the crypt will soon form. However, the expression patterns of this and other adult stem cell markers in amniotic embryos have not been systematically studied, and indeed, whether or not Lgr5-positive cells are even present prior to birth has remained uncertain.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0035">It is clear, however, that morphological villi arise before birth (or hatching in birds). Perhaps surprisingly, although stem cell proliferation and differentiation are critical for homeostatic maintenance of the villi, the initial formation of the villi does not appear to be a stem-cell-dependent phenomenon, at least in the chick. Morphogenesis of the lumen of the chick gut occurs in a stepwise progression wherein the initially smooth lining of the primitive gut tube is first transformed by compressive forces into a series of longitudinal parallel ridges. These are then deformed into a series of regular zigzag ridges. Finally, the zigzags segment to give rise to individual villi (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib6 bib34" id="crosrefs0010" >Coulombre and Coulombre, 1958; Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-refs>) (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs1" id="crosref0085" >Figure S1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="figs1"/>A). A similar process occurs in the formation of human villi (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib16 bib24" id="crosrefs0015">Hilton, 1902; Lacroix et al., 1984</ce:cross-refs>). The formation of the ridges is driven by the differentiation of the first circumferential smooth muscle layer of the intestine. This forms a barrier restricting further expansion as the inner submucosal and endodermal layers continue to proliferate, resulting in their buckling. Similarly, the zigzags form due to compressive forces generated by further submucosal and endodermal growth when the second longitudinal smooth muscle layer differentiates, creating orthogonal barriers to expansion in both the longitudinal and radial directions. Finally, the arms of the zigzags each give rise to individual villi as the third, innermost layer of longitudinal smooth muscle differentiates in the context of a decrease in proliferation along the top of the zigzags (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0090">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>). This previous study thus addressed the mechanism by which villi first form in the developing chick gut. However, this work begs the question of why proliferation suddenly drops at the tips of the folds at the zigzag stage and also leaves unanswered the critical question of how stem cells are localized to the base of the villi as they form. These issues are the focus of this current study.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0030">Results</ce:section-title><ce:section id="sec2.1"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0035">Intestinal Stem Cell Markers Are Expressed Uniformly in the Early Mammalian Gut and Are Refined during Villus Formation</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0040">Although the definitive ISCs of the postnatal intestine are derived from the endoderm of the primitive gut tube and the early gut epithelium has been hypothesized to be a uniform stem-cell-like pool (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7" id="crosref0095">Crosnier et al., 2006</ce:cross-ref>), it has remained unclear whether ISC markers are expressed at these early stages. To test this, we took advantage of a murine GFP knock-in allele of the best-studied ISC marker, Lgr5 (EGFP-IRES-creERT2) (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib1" id="crosref0100">Barker et al., 2007</ce:cross-ref>). Strikingly, Lgr5-expressing cells are found throughout the epithelium in the embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) small intestine, just prior to villus formation (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig1" id="crosref0105" >Figure 1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig1"/>A). Over the following days of development, Lgr5 expression is lost in the forming villus tip and is progressively restricted to the space between villi as they form (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig1" id="crosref0110">Figure 1</ce:cross-ref>A). A second ISC marker, CD44 (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib18" id="crosref0115" >Itzkovitz et al., 2012</ce:cross-ref>), follows a similar progression albeit with slightly delayed kinetics (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig1" id="crosref0120">Figure 1</ce:cross-ref>B).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0045">In the adult intestine, canonical Wnt signaling is essential for maintaining ISCs. In previous studies, markers for active Wnt signaling, such as Sox9, have been reported to be initially expressed uniformly throughout the embryonic gut but are then restricted to the intervillous space as villi form (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib3 bib10 bib12" id="crosrefs0020">Blache et al., 2004; Formeister et al., 2009; Furuyama et al., 2011</ce:cross-refs>). Moreover, previous reports have shown that epithelial proliferation follows the same progressive restriction from the tip of forming villi (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib7" id="crosref0125" >Crosnier et al., 2006</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0050">These data suggest that the ISCs localized at the base of the villi at birth are remnants of a broader precursor stem cell population found throughout the early gut endoderm. To directly test whether this is the case, we made use of the inducible Cre present in the Lgr5 knock-in allele and crossed it into the background of a Rosa26-tdTomato floxed reporter that is irreversibly activated in the presence of Cre recombinase, marking the cells in which Cre is expressed and also their descendants. We labeled cells by inducing Cre activity at E13.5, a stage when the entire epithelium is proliferative and expresses Lgr5. We then sectioned guts of postnatal animals, a time when stem cells are localized to the base of the villi and to the inter-villus regions, and examined them for tdTomato expression. We observed staining at the base of the villi that colocalized with Lgr5 expression and, in many cases, also saw staining along the sides of the villi (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig1" id="crosref0130" >Figure 1</ce:cross-ref>C) even though, at this stage, the epithelial cells of the villi do not actively express Lgr5. As the epithelial cells of the villi at this stage are known to be derived from the stem cells at their base, these data indicate that the embryonically labeled Lgr5-positive cells are indeed the progenitors of the post-natal intestinal stem cells <ce:cross-ref id="cecref440" refid="tbl1">Table 2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="tbl1"/>.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0055">Although the villi in mouse appear to be established through similar compressive forces as in the chick (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0135">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>), they arise much more quickly and without the clear stepwise progression seen in the chick (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs1" id="crosref0140" >Figure S1</ce:cross-ref>B). To investigate when in this process the stem cells are localized, we therefore switched systems to the chick.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.2"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0040">Stem Cells Are Restricted Late in Chick Endodermal Morphogenesis as Zigzags Become Compact and Begin to Morph into Pre-villus Bulges</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0060">As Lgr5 expression is difficult to detect in the developing chick midgut, we utilized single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to locate Lgr5-expressing cells across chick intestinal development. Lgr5 is expressed uniformly throughout the early embryonic intestinal epithelium and continues as such through the early stages of epithelial morphogenesis into ridges and zigzags (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig2" id="crosref0145">Figures 2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig2" />A and <ce:cross-ref refid="figs2" id="crosref0150" >S2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="figs2"/>A). However, by E15, as the zigzags attain their maximal compaction just before they begin to morph into the bulges that will give rise to villi, Lgr5 expression is diminished in the tip of the epithelial fold. By hatching, expression is predominantly limited to the intervillous space (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig2" id="crosref0155">Figures 2</ce:cross-ref>A and <ce:cross-ref refid="figs2" id="crosref0160">S2</ce:cross-ref>A). Similarly, Sox9 is expressed uniformly in the early chick intestinal epithelium and is lost at the tips of the folds by E15 (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig2" id="crosref0165" >Figure 2</ce:cross-ref>B). Thus, the localization of both putative stem cells and of the Wnt signaling that supports them becomes restricted just before the pre-villus bulges start to emerge. We have previously noted that this transition from zigzags to bulges also correlates with and, indeed, depends upon a progressive restriction of proliferation from the tips of the folded luminal surface E15 (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0170" >Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.3"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0045">A Signaling Center Correlating with the Timing and Localization of Stem Cells in the Forming Gut</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0065">A potential clue for how epithelial proliferation and stem cell identity might be regulated comes from the mouse, where lack of proliferation at the villus tip has previously been correlated with the presence of a signaling center in the distal mesenchyme of the nascent villi, called the “villus cluster” (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib19" id="crosref0175">Karlsson et al., 2000</ce:cross-ref>), which expresses PDGFRα, Gli1, Ptc1, Bmp2, and Bmp4 (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib19 bib39" id="crosrefs0025">Karlsson et al., 2000;Walton et al., 2012</ce:cross-refs>). In the chick, we find that the same suite of genes is expressed at a high level in the equivalent location at the tip of the highly folded epithelium at E15, although the same genes are expressed at a lower level at earlier time points in a narrow band directly under the entire epithelium (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig3" id="crosref0180" >Figure 3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig3"/>A). The time when the villus cluster genes are upregulated is the same stage as when the overlying distal epithelium loses stem cell marker expression and as when proliferation decreases in the distal domain of the epithelium (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0185">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>). The chick villus cluster includes cluster-specific expression of Foxf1, a transcription factor implicated in villi formation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib29" id="crosref0190">Ormestad et al., 2006</ce:cross-ref>) but not previously observed in the cluster, as well as PDGFRα, Ptc1, and Bmp4 (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig3" id="crosref0195" >Figure 3</ce:cross-ref>A). We also examined phospho-SMAD staining, as a reporter of Bmp activity, during chick gut morphogenesis. Phospho-SMAD reactivity is identified with a timing that correlates with the onset of high-level Bmp expression in the villus cluster and negatively correlates with the localization of Lgr5 expression (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig3" id="crosref0200">Figure 3</ce:cross-ref>B).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0070">It has recently been shown that, in mouse, the villus cluster expression of Bmp4 and the general Shh target Ptc1 are downstream of hedgehog signaling (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib39 bib29" id="crosrefs0030" >Walton et al., 2012; Ormestad et al., 2006</ce:cross-refs>). Moreover, it has long been known that, at earlier stages in chick gut formation, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is responsible for inducing expression of Bmp4 in the underlying mesenchynme (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib31" id="crosref0205">Roberts et al., 1995</ce:cross-ref>). Accordingly, we find that, in the chick, villus cluster-specific expression of Ptc1and BMP4, as well as Foxf1, is lost upon inhibition of Hedgehog signaling by cyclopamine and expanded in response to additional Shh protein (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0210">Figure 4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig4" />A). As expected, the decrease or increase of Bmp4 expression, in response to cyclopamine or Shh, respectively, is reflected by a concomitant respective loss of or broadening of phospho-SMAD reactivity (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0215">Figure 4</ce:cross-ref>B).</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.4"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0050">A Feedback Loop from the Villus Cluster to the Epithelium Localizes Stem Cells to the Base of the Forming Villi</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0075">To test whether signals from the villus cluster, in fact, direct the fate of cells in the neighboring epithelium, we excised a small segment of intestine from an E14 chick embryo, when progenitors are uniformly distributed and before the villus cluster has formed, and manipulated cluster signals in vitro during 36 hr of culture. Control cultures display strong Edu labeling, which is indicative of proliferation exclusively at the base of the fold, just like their E15.5 in vivo counterparts (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0220" >Figure 4</ce:cross-ref>C). However, culturing in the presence of the hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine or the Bmp inhibitor Noggin results in expansion of proliferation throughout the endoderm, including the villus tips (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0225">Figure 4</ce:cross-ref>C). Conversely, in explants cultured in the presence Shh or Bmp4, proliferation is absent not just from the tips of the villi, but from the entire endodermal layer. As shown above, Shh activity is responsible for inducing Bmp4 expression in the underlying mesenchyme. To confirm this epistatic relationship in this context, we simultaneously treated cultures with both Shh and Noggin. Application of both Shh and Noggin to gut segments in culture mimics the effects of Noggin alone, maintaining proliferation throughout the endoderm (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0230" >Figure 4</ce:cross-ref>C). Thus, as expected, endodermally derived Shh activity is upstream of mesenchymal Bmp4 expression, and Bmp4 activity represses endodermal proliferation.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0080">Wnt signaling is an important niche signal for maintaining ISCs in the mature intestine.

Blocking Shh or BMP signaling resulted in uniform staining of the Wnt target Sox9 throughout the gut epithelium, whereas control gut tissue only showed Sox9 expression in the lower half of the villi (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig4" id="crosref0235" >Figure 4</ce:cross-ref>D).

A plausible model explaining this localized, elevated response to Shh takes note of the fact that a uniformly secreted protein will be at a higher concentration in locations where the target tissue is surrounded by morphogen-producing tissue (e.g., at the curved tip of the highly folded epithelium) than where it is only adjacent to the source of the morphogen on one side (e.g., at the base of the folds). This is supported by computational modeling, which shows that a highly folded epithelium, or finger-like pocket, indeed results in both an increase in a morphogen concentration gradient and a greater depth of high-level signaling below the endoderm, relative to a similarly scaled, wider fold (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs3" id="crosref0265">Figure S3</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="figs3"/> and <ce:cross-ref refid="dtbox1" id="crosref0270" >Extended Experimental Procedures</ce:cross-ref>). The slow, stepwise nature of villi formation in chick allows for a detailed investigation of this hypothesis for how the villus cluster arises. During the stages in which the lumen takes on an increasingly compact zigzag topography (E13, E14, and E15) we find that the cross-sectional shape of these structures changes in concert (low peak, narrow peak, and rounded tip, respectively) (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig5" id="crosref0275">Figures 5</ce:cross-ref>A and 5B<ce:float-anchor refid="fig5"/>). This would be predicted to lead to increasingly concentrated gradients of endodermally derived signaling at the tip (schematized in <ce:cross-ref refid="fig5" id="crosref0280" >Figure 5</ce:cross-ref>B).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0100">To directly test this idea, we examined the distribution of Shh with an antibody directed against this protein. Anti-Shh staining intensity was plotted along a line from the tip of the folded epithelium and orthogonal to it (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig5" id="crosref0285" >Figure 5</ce:cross-ref>D). Prior to E15, anti-Shh reactivity is identified in the epithelium and the mesenchyme just subjacent to the endoderm. However, at the transition from zigzags to bulges, the mesenchyme in the distal domain of the folded tissue showed significantly elevated Shh protein accumulation. In addition, the shape of the gradient tapers off much more slowly within the highly folded epithelium of the E15 gut than within the broader fold seen at E13. This is consistent with expectations, since—in addition to Shh protein diffusing from the tip—the mesenchyme within the narrowly folded E15 epithelium is exposed to Shh secreted from the epithelium lateral to it, augmenting the gradient. At both stages, the highest level of Shh staining is observed within the epithelium itself, which is to be expected as the antibody will detect both extracellular and intracellular protein in the tissue producing the Shh. Importantly, however, the level of Shh produced by the epithelium, averaged for the nine sections assayed at each time point, is equivalent at E13 and E15. To further verify that the architecture of the tissue affects Shh protein accumulation, we compared the concentration of Shh protein 5 microns below the tip of the epithelial fold at E15 versus the concentration present at the same distance below the base of the fold. As expected, the intensity of staining is much higher within the fold, providing a mechanism explaining localized high-level Shh signaling at the epithelial tips.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0105">If the mesenchyme responds to Shh by activating villus cluster genes at a high threshold concentration, this would explain the observed localization of high-level villus cluster gene expression. Indeed, examination of the expression pattern of villus cluster markers such as PDGFα and Bmp4 gives results consistent with this model (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig5" id="crosref0290">Figure 5</ce:cross-ref>C). Consistent with epithelial morphogenesis acting upstream of increased Shh signaling and hence villus cluster gene activity, and not vice versa, after treating with cyclopamine to block hedgehog signaling, we observed no alteration in the global structure of the epithelium or in individual epithelial or mesenchymal cell shape, using membrane-bound β-catenin to outline cell contours (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs4" id="crosref0295" >Figure S4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="figs4"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0110">To test whether the bending of the epithelium into more tightly curved domains, with consequent high levels of localized signaling, is indeed responsible for the upregulation of villus cluster genes in the tips of these structures, we undertook a simple experimental manipulation designed to “open” the normally tightly folded epithelium. Ringlets of embryonic intestine were excised at E14 and placed into culture in vitro. The folds in the epithelium arise due to constraint on the proliferating inner layers by subadjacent differentiated smooth muscle (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0300">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>). To alter this physical constraint, half of the rings were turned inside out, putting the endoderm and mesenchyme outside of the rings of smooth muscle, allowing the epithelium more length to take on a less folded form (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0305" >Figure 6</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig6"/>A). Following 36 hr of culture, the inside-out ringlets indeed had a broader contour than their right-side-out counterparts. After culture, the ringlets were sectioned and processed for in situ hybridization with various villus cluster probes (Ptc1, Bmp4, PDGFRα, and Foxf1). Each of these was strongly expressed at the fold tips of the control ringlets, but all were expressed uniformly at a lower level under the epithelium in the inside-out ringlets (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0310">Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>B). Moreover, phospho-SMAD staining, indicative of Bmp upregulation in villus clusters, is also greatly diminished in the inside-out ringlets relative to control cultures (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0315" >Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>B). These results suggest that the villus cluster forms in the mesenchyme at the tip of the fold because those cells are almost completely encapsulated by Shh-expressing epithelium, allowing high threshold responses to be activated.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0115">Preventing villus cluster formation by flipping the intestines inside out results in an absence of the localized Bmp signal that we demonstrated is responsible for restricting ISC localization within the gut epithelium. Thus, the inside-out ringlets of guts would be expected to maintain stem cell properties and proliferation throughout their epithelium. Indeed, such manipulations lead to maintenance of uniform proliferation throughout the epithelium, whereas proliferation is lost in the epithelium surrounding the cluster that forms in control rings (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0320">Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>B). Similarly, uniform expression of the Wnt target Sox9 and the ISC marker Lgr5 is maintained in the inside-out guts lacking villus cluster gene expression, whereas it is restricted from the folded tips in controls (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0325">Figures 6</ce:cross-ref>B and <ce:cross-ref refid="figs2" id="crosref0330" >S2</ce:cross-ref>C).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0120">As a second way of preventing late stages of epithelial morphogenesis, we took advantage of a drug, FK506, that has been shown to block smooth muscle differentiation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib11" id="crosref0335">Fukuda et al., 1998</ce:cross-ref>). As we previously showed (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0340">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>), differentiation of smooth muscle layers is necessary for generation of the compressive forces that buckle the endoderm into ridges, zigzags, and then villi. We cultured guts in vitro from ridge stage to late zigzag stage, with or without the presence of FK506. Consistent with the results described above, without longitudinal muscle differentiation, and hence without progressing beyond parallel ridges, the entire endoderm remains proliferative, and villus cluster genes are never upregulated. As in vivo, control cultures display restricted distal proliferation and activation of villus cluster gene expression (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs5" id="crosref0345" >Figure S5</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="figs5"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0125">These results indicate that the three-dimensional folding of the epithelium is necessary to locally increase Shh signaling (as seen in Ptc1 expression) and induce the villus cluster genes.

Slabs of embryonic gut were excised at E10, when the gut is folded into several wide ridges, and placed into culture in vitro. Half of the slabs were placed under a fine grid, causing the luminal surface to fold, with continued growth, into many small villus-like bumps, long before endogenous villus formation takes place (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0350">Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>C). Slabs were cultured for 36 hr and then processed for in situ hybridization with various villus cluster probes (Ptc1, Bmp4, Foxf1, and PDGFα). After 36 hr in culture, there is no change in expression of Shh itself, which continues to be expressed uniformly in the epithelium under these conditions (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0355">Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>D). However, while villus cluster gene expression in control segments is nearly uniform at a low level under the epithelium, samples grown under the grid display elevated expression in the mesenchyme under areas of highest epithelial curvature. PhosphoSMAD staining is observed in the same locations reflecting the change in BMP pathway activity (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0360">Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>D). Therefore, simply morphing the tissue into the necessary shape can induce villus cluster-like local maxima of Shh responsive genes. Further, whereas proliferation and Sox9 expression are uniform in the control epithelium, in the samples cultured under the grid, proliferation and Sox9 expression are lost from the tips of the folds, surrounding the areas where mesenchymal expression of cluster genes is highest (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig6" id="crosref0365" >Figure 6</ce:cross-ref>D).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0130">Taken together, these results demonstrate that the villus cluster genes are induced at local maxima of Shh activity, resulting from the additive effect of signaling that is compounded through the folding of the overlying epithelium.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec2.6"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0060">Villus Formation in the Mouse</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0135">To examine the universality of the mechanism we have described, we returned to the developing mouse gut. As previously described (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib33 bib39 bib34" id="crosrefs0040">Sbarbati, 1982; Walton et al., 2012; Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-refs>), the villi of the embryonic mouse gut form directly within the lumen without going through intermediate ridge and zigzag stages of epithelial folding. A critical question, in terms of the model we derived from the chick, is whether the epithelium buckles prior to expression of the villus cluster genes in mouse. To address this, we serially sectioned E14.5 mouse guts and carefully examined each section. This is the stage when villi first arise in the mouse midgut, forming in a rostral to caudal progression. Thus, at this stage, the caudal-most region of the small intestine exhibits no epithelial projections (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0370" >Figure 7</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig7"/>A). Consistent with our previous studies showing that smooth muscle differentiation is required for villus formation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0375" >Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>), we also see no evidence of the longitudinal smooth muscle in this domain, using smooth muscle actin (SMA) as a marker (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0380" >Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>A). More rostrally, we see the first buckling of the endoderm into small “alcoves,” concomitant with the first appearance of the longitudinal smooth muscle staining (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0385">Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>B). However, careful examination of serial sections fails to detect any sign of expression of upregulation of the villus cluster gene PDGFRα at this rostrocaudal level (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0390">Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>B). It is only when one moves still further rostrally that one sees deeper alcoves displaying strong PDGFRα expression at their tips (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0395">Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>C). Thus, epithelial morphogenesis precedes villus cluster gene activation. These descriptive data are at least consistent with the activation of villus cluster gene expression in the mouse being a consequence of higher level Shh signaling in pockets of buckled epithelium.</ce:para><ce:para id="p0140">To directly test whether changing the architecture of the epithelium would affect villus cluster gene expression in the mouse, we returned to the experiment, creating premature pseudo-villi in the mouse gut by forcing growth through a fine grid at E13.5, prior to epithelial buckling. As in the chick, following 24 hr of incubation, the luminal surface folded into many small villus-like bumps extending through the holes in the grid. Whereas control guts did not show any signs of villus cluster gene expression following culture, samples grown under the grid showed strong upregulation of PGFRα at the tip of each pseudo-villus (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0400">Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>D).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0145">As described above, both proliferation and the stem cell marker Lgr5 are restricted from the tips of the forming mouse villi once villus cluster gene expression is activated. To see whether, as in chick, this is due to high-level Shh signaling, we cultured developing mouse guts in vitro and blocked the Shh pathway with cyclopamine. Cyclopamine treatment was sufficient to expand both proliferation and expression of stem cell markers, CD44, Sox9, and Lgr5, in the tips of the forming villi in the treated guts, whereas control guts cultured in the absence of cyclopamine appeared similar to their in vivo counterparts (<ce:cross-ref refid="fig7" id="crosref0405">Figure 7</ce:cross-ref>E).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0150">These data support the hypothesis that, as in chick, it is mechanical deformation of the gut epithelium that leads to high concentrations of Shh, hence induction of villus cluster genes in the mesenchyme and consequent restriction of stem cells in the underlying endoderm.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0065">Discussion</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0155">Our study has elucidated a series of steps integrating physical morphogenesis of the gut epithelium with restriction of stem cells to the base of the forming villi. Shh expressed by the endoderm is concentrated toward the tips of the buckling epithelial layer because of the repositioning of the source of the signal to surround the distal mesenchyme. This results in the induction of a signaling center, the villus cluster, as a high-threshold response. Bmp activity, emanating from the villus cluster, acts to oppose Wnt signaling and thereby leads to the sequestering of Wnt-supported proliferative ISCs to the base of the villi.</ce:para><ce:section id="sec3.1"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0070">Localization of ISCs in Mice</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0160">Intriguingly, although the intestinal lining of both birds and eutherian mammals is characterized by the presence of long finger-like villi, this morphology appears to have evolved convergently, as the gut morphology of lower animals, including fish (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib38" id="crosref0410">Walker et al., 2004</ce:cross-ref>), amphibians (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib27" id="crosref0415">McAvoy and Dixon, 1978</ce:cross-ref>), reptiles (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib9 bib22" id="crosrefs0045">Ferri et al., 1976; Kotzé and Soley, 1995</ce:cross-refs>), and even monotremes (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib23" id="crosref0420">Krause, 1975</ce:cross-ref>), include various forms of ridges and folds to increase the surface area of the lining of the gut, but not individual villi. The tight packing and long projections of individual villi that represent an optimized solution for increasing surface area (hence allowing maximal absorption of nutrients) may have been selected for independently in the two most highly metabolic lineages, mammals and birds. The stepwise progression of mucosal folds from ridges to zigzags to villi has been well described in the chick (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib6" id="crosref0425">Coulombre and Coulombre, 1958</ce:cross-ref>). A similar series of transitions, involving segmentation of pre-villus ridges to form villi, has been described for several mammals, including cattle (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib40" id="crosref0430">Winkler and Wille, 1998</ce:cross-ref>) and humans (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib16 bib24" id="crosrefs0050">Hilton,1902; Lacroix et al., 1984</ce:cross-refs>). In striking contrast, the villi of the murine intestine form directly from the floor of a smooth epithelium (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib33" id="crosref0435" >Sbarbati, 1982</ce:cross-ref>). The process of villus formation in the mouse does, nonetheless, share at least some mechanistic aspects with the chick and other guts where villi form via segmentation. In both chick and mouse embryonic gut, villus formation is prevented by blocking differentiation of the smooth muscle (which, at least in chick, acts as a barrier to expansion of the epithelium, thereby causing mucosal buckling). Moreover, modeling of the physical properties of the embryonic mouse intestine indicates that compressive mechanical forces induced by constrained growth are sufficient to explain the emergence of villi in mice as in chick (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib34" id="crosref0440">Shyer et al., 2013</ce:cross-ref>).</ce:para><ce:para id="p0165">Consistent with this, we found that, concomitant with smooth muscle differentiation, the mouse epithelium buckles into small alcoves that could, in principle, lead to local elevated concentrations of Shh protein prior to the onset of villus cluster gene expression. As in the chick, stem cell markers and Wnt-responsive genes are expressed uniformly throughout the gut epithelium prior to this point and are downregulated at the tips of the forming villi as the villus cluster genes are expressed. Also, as in the chick, blocking the Shh pathway, and thus downstream BMP signaling, is sufficient to expand proliferation and the expression of Lgr5, suggesting that the presence of Shh signaling normally acts to restrict them from the villus tips. Finally, creating villus-like structures prematurely results in the upregulation of a marker of the villus cluster through geometric constraint. Although the central features involved in gut stem cell localization during villus formation, thus, appear to be the same in mice and chicks, there is some evidence that there may be differences as well. For example, formation of the villus cluster in the mouse appears to involve cell aggregation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib39" id="crosref0445">Walton et al., 2012</ce:cross-ref>), as well as induction of gene expression, a feature we have not observed in the chick. Further work will be required to gain a fuller picture of how villus formation and stem cell location are achieved in mice and to integrate other findings with the results described here.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.2"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0075">Bmp Antagonism of Wnt Activity in Restricting Proliferation and Stem Cell Activity</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0170">Our data show that the net result of the Shh-Bmp signaling cascade is a restriction of proliferation, as well as a decrease in expression of Wnt-dependent stem cell markers at the tips of the developing epithelial folds. We did not, in the context of this study, explore how this is achieved. However, a similar Bmp antagonism of Wnt activity has previously been described in the context of the adult intestinal stem cell niche. As we observed embryonically, Bmp ligands are also strongly produced by the inter-villus mesenchyme near the tips of the adult villi with a decreasing gradient toward the crypts (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib15 bib14 bib13 bib2" id="crosrefs0055">He et al., 2004; Hardwick et al., 2004; Haramis et al., 2004; Batts et al., 2006</ce:cross-refs>). Moreover, this Bmp activity in the adult villus acts to suppress Wnt signaling to control the balance of stem cell renewal and differentiation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib15" id="crosref0450">He et al., 2004</ce:cross-ref>). In this context, the Bmp and Wnt pathways are integrated intracellularly at the level of a PTEN/Akt-dependent mechanism (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib37" id="crosref0455">Tian et al., 2005</ce:cross-ref>). It seems likely that this same or a similar mechanism is employed downstream of Bmp activity at the earlier stage investigated here.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.3"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0080">Mechanically Based Induction of Gene Expression</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0175">The physical reshaping of morphogenic gradients represents an intriguing paradigm in the integration of mechanics and developmental signaling. Of course, in addition to this mechanism, many instances have been described wherein forces impact gene expression through mechanosensory signal transduction. In a formal sense, it is certainly possible that mechanosensory signaling also contributes to the activation of target gene expression during gut epithelial morphogenesis. However, we emphasize that ectopic action of Shh is sufficient to induce villus cluster gene expression and to restrict the location of stem cells and proliferation, while blocking Shh activity is sufficient to result in a loss of villus cluster gene expression and expansion of proliferation and stem cell localization. Moreover, addition of cyclopamine has no effect on the contour of the epithelium or the shape of individual epithelial cells (<ce:cross-ref refid="figs4" id="crosref0460">Figure S4</ce:cross-ref>). As the epithelium is bent equivalently under conditions with or without cyclopamine, the cells should be seeing equivalent strains and stresses, and hence similar mechanosensory signaling. Yet the cultures with cyclopamine lose villus cluster gene expression, whereas control cultures do not, clearly indicating that there is at least a major part of the process that is independent of mechanosensory transduction.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec3.4"><ce:section-title id="sectitle0085">Initiation of Discrete Signaling Centers</ce:section-title><ce:para id="p0180">Mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk is an established principle in developmental biology—for example, the positive feedback loop between the mesenchymal zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and epithelial apical epidermal ridge (AER) in limb development (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib25 bib28" id="crosrefs0060">Laufer et al., 1994; Niswander et al., 1994</ce:cross-refs>) or the reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in tooth germ formation (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib36" id="crosref0465">Thesleff, 2003</ce:cross-ref>). A number of mechanisms have been described for establishing the localized signaling centers necessary for such interactions. These include reliance on upstream positional information, such as the posterior pre-pattern of Hox gene expression necessary to establish the mesenchymal ZPA signaling center in the limb (<ce:cross-refs refid="bib5 bib21" id="crosrefs0065">Charité et al., 1994; Knezevic et al., 1997</ce:cross-refs>), and lateral inhibition such as that seen in setting up the spacing of the enamel knot signal centers in tooth bud development (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib32" id="crosref0470">Salazar-Ciudad, 2012</ce:cross-ref>). However, the work here highlights a different mechanism involving the use of a uniformly produced signal, concentrated not by diffusion or feedback loops but by physical deformation of the morphogenic field. Employing the shape changes of the developing tissue to dictate where signals arise artfully links the process of building a structure with the proper placement of its molecularly defined cell types. In the case of the intestine, this mechanism assures that specialized cells, like ISCs, end up in the right location at the base of each villi as these structures take shape. Recently, it has been shown that tissue architecture can similarly concentrate signaling in the context of the developing zebrafish lateral line (<ce:cross-ref refid="bib8" id="crosref0475">Durdu et al., 2014</ce:cross-ref>), although, in this instance, the mechanisms that create the luminal pockets where morphogens can accumulate remain unclear and may not be related to upstream physical forces.
